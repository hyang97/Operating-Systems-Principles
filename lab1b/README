Strange bug: using --encrypt for both client and server would result in some
mistakes printed out to the console. specifically, the first 16 bytes would be
incorrectly decrypted from the server output (or perhaps, the server is
incorrectly encrypting the shell output). I'm fairly confident the problem
doesn't lie with the client encryption or server decryption, since the proper
commands were executed the the output was expected, it was just the first 16
bytes that were strange.

FIX: I padded 16 bytes in front of the messages sent from the server to the
client. this seems to achieve the desired behavior, albeit ignoring a more
sinister underlying bug.
