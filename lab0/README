Features:
- program directs input (from fd 0) to output (from fd 1)
- requires arguments for --input and --output if the options are present but
arguments not provided
- --input and --output can be omitted, program behaves as expected using stdin
and stdout. if either are omitted, program behaves as expected using either
stdin or stdout.
- --segfault will result in Segmentation Fault
- --catch without --segfault will not trigger Segmentation Fault
- --catch with --segfault will print out "Caught segmentation fault!" to stderr
and exit with code 3
- if input file is unable to be opened, then program exits with error messages
and error code 1
- if output file is unable to be opened or created, then program exits with
error messages and error code 2

Limitations:
- doesn't output specific reason for failure to open/create output file (such as
not having write permissions). this is fine because it isn't required by the
spec

Testing methodology:
- tested behavior combination of yes/no input/output arguments
- tested behavior for unwriteable output file
- tested behavior for nonexistent input file
- tested behavior for combinations of --segfault and --catch
