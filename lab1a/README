Project 1A

lab1a.c:
- single source file, default behavior is to turn the terminal into
non-canonical, no echo mode. using --shell argument, the terminal is still in
that same mode but the input is sent to a separate running bash process, whose
output is then printed out to the console. this entails that commands can be
executed in the other bash console, and the corresponding results will be
displayed.
- in terms of testing, sent signals using the ps command to check the pid of the
child process and using the corresponding pid to send the signal. also used $?
to check the return code of the program to make sure it's behaving as
expected. aside from sending signals, i just tried a bunch of commands and typed
a bunch of stuff to see that the terminal was behaving as expected.
* submitted two days late because busy schedule & my own negligence and the fact
that I underestimated how confusing the spec is

Makefile:
- has make, clean, and dist options
- make option compiles c file with the -pthread option
- clean just removes the executable
- dist packages the source file, Makefile, and README into a tar.gz
