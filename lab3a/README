Limitations:
In order to comply with the spec, there are the limitations:
- strictly only traverses indirect blocks that are known to be allocated from
the inode num block field
- for whatever reason, if I print out the entire name for each directory, the
string has some additional characters at the end. not sure why, but printing
just the exact number of characters defined by the name_len field will result in
the correct name
- for the directory part of the assignment, we ignore the num block information
for the inode and stick to the actual number of allocated nodes -- this is
probably due to the fact that the disk image is damaged

Features:
All aspects of the spec implemented

Testing:
Tested output against provided csv files
